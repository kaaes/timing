Breaking Down onLoad
====================

This script has a form of bookmarklet and uses [Navigation Timing object](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html) to present timing of different phases of loading the page by a browser. It measures everything from triggering the action (hitting enter on url bar, refreshing page or clicking a link/button) to the moment when site is fully loaded.

It is a visual presentation of the content of `performance.timing` object.

Adding it to your bookmarks allows you to analyze performance of every request you'd like to check out.

So far Navigation Timing API works in Firefox 7+, Chrome and IE 9+
